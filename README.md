We employed a two-dimensional numerical simulation to study the advection–diffusion-driven mixing of two magma endmembers with distinct Sr and Nd abundances and isotope ratios. The model is based on the classical advection–diffusion equation. 
The computational domain is a 2D periodic box, initially divided into two halves occupied by endmembers A (left) and B (right), each with specified Sr, Nd concentrations and isotopic compositions. 
This version assumes constant viscosity and fixed flow velocity, without dynamic coupling or velocity capping, making it suitable for investigating fundamental mixing patterns under idealized conditions.
The first file is the code which only involves Sr and Nd and their isotopes. The second file is the code involving 22 elements.
